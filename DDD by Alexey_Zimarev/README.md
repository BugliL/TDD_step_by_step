# Domain Driven Design

Domain-driven design (DDD) is an approach to software development for complex needs by connecting the implementation 
to an evolving model.  

This section follow the book and try to implement the same code of the book but in Python using different data 
structures but trying to follow the logic and the method.

## The Application
Directly from the book, the software to be developed solve the problem:
> selling stuff online for private individuals. We'll be building an application to publish classified ads and 
> something that might be necessary to support this type of activity. If you aren't familiar with the terminology, 
> think about a bunch of stuff you have in your storage room or in the basement, which you would be delighted to remove. 
> You can publish a small ad online, and other people might buy things that you no longer need.
