# Test driven development exercises

Repository to exercise myself with test driven development using
the book "Test Driven Development" by Kent Beck and with
refactoring using the book "Refactoring: Improving the
Design of Existing Code" by Martin Fowler

I will use python to do it instead of Java or Javascipt, as in the books, adapting data and code to
be executed correcly.
