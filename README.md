# Test driven development exercises

Repository to exercise myself with test driven development using the book "Test Driven Development" by Kent Beck and with refactoring using the book "The art of refactoring" by Martin Fowler



I will use python to do it instead of Java or Javascipt, as in the books, adapting data and code to
be executed correcly.
