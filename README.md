# Test driven development exercises

Repository to exercise myself with test driven development using
the books
 * "Test Driven Development" by Kent Beck 
 * "Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code" by Martin Fowler
 * "Hands-On Domain-Driven Design with .NET Core" by Alexey Zimarev"

I will use python to do it instead of Java or Javascipt, as in the books, adapting data and code to
be executed correctly.  
Most of code in this repository is similar to books source code intentionally to help me remember exercises.
