Good behavior to write code:
1) Only one level of indentation for method
2) Do not use Else
3) Wrap all primitives
4) First class collections
5) One dot per line
6) Don't abbreviate
7) Keep all entities small
8) No classes with more than 2 instance variables
9) No getter/setter/properties

How to perform test driven development
1) make a "todo list" of things to do to have focus on things to do
2) choose a task
3) write a test in the same way the code is working
