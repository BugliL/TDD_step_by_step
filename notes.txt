Good behavior to write code:
1) Only one level of indentation for method
2) Do not use Else
3) Wrap all primitives
4) First class collections
5) One dot per line
6) Don't abbreviate
7) Keep all entities small
8) No classes with more than 2 instance variables
9) No getter/setter/properties

10) remove duplication

How to perform test driven development
1) make a "todo list" of things to do to have focus on things to do
2) choose a task
3) write a little test in the same way the code SHOULD work
4) Run all test and check if just last one is failing
5) Make a little change to the code (the smallest is the better)
6) Run test and check if green, if it's red goto point 5

In the phase when all tests are Green, it's possible to refactor the actual
code to make it better. In this phase all test stay there to support the
running code while making changes.
